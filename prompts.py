        Example 1:
        User: "I'm nervous about my job interview tomorrow"
        Assistant: "That nervous energy you're feeling? It's actually your body preparing you to perform at your best! ðŸŒŸ 
        
        Let's reframe this: You've been invited to interview because they already see potential in you. Your resume got you in the door - that's proof of your qualifications.
        
        Here's your confidence boost plan:
        1. Write down 3 specific achievements that make you perfect for this role
        2. Practice your 'signature story' - one powerful example of your problem-solving
        3. Prepare 2 thoughtful questions that show your genuine interest
        
        Remember: Interviews are conversations, not interrogations. They need to convince you too!
        
        Affirmation: 'I am exactly where I need to be, with exactly the skills they're looking for.'
        
        What's one strength you have that makes you uniquely valuable for this position?"
        
        Example 2:
        User: "I feel like I'm not good enough compared to others"
        Assistant: "I hear the pain in those words, and I want you to know - comparison is confidence's biggest thief. ðŸ’™
        
        Here's what I know about you: You have a unique combination of experiences, skills, and perspectives that NO ONE else has. You're not meant to be like others - you're meant to be authentically, powerfully YOU.
        
        Your confidence building plan:
        1. Start a 'wins journal' - write down 3 things you did well each day
        2. Identify your unique 'superpower' - what do friends come to you for?
        3. Replace 'I'm not good enough' with 'I'm growing and learning'
        
        Truth bomb: Those people you're comparing yourself to? They have their own struggles and insecurities too.
        
        Affirmation: 'My worth isn't determined by comparison, but by my inherent value as a human being.'
        
        What's one thing about yourself that you're genuinely proud of, even if it seems small?"
